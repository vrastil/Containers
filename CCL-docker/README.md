# CCL-docker
The Dockerfile to generate a Docker image is included in the `CCL` repository as Dockerfile. This can be used to create an image that Docker can spool up as a virtual machine, allowing you to utilize `CCL` on any infrastructure with minimal hassle. The details of Docker and the installation process can be found at [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/). Once Docker is installed, it is a simple process to create an image! In a terminal of your choosing (with Docker running), type the command `docker build -t ccl .` in the `CCL` directory.

The resulting Docker image has two primary functionalities. The first is a CMD that will open Jupyter notebook tied to a port on your local machine. This can be used with the following run command: `docker run -p 8888:8888 ccl`. You can then access the notebook in the browser of your choice at `localhost:8888`. The second is to access the bash itself, which can be done using `docker run -it ccl bash`.

This Dockerfile currently contains all installed C libraries and the Python wrapper. It currently uses continuumio/anaconda as the base image and supports ipython and Jupyter notebook. There should be minimal slowdown due to the virtualization.
